# Robot_Gui_V3
This is a QT/C++ based configurable dashboard that is currently in progress.
This idea is that you can configure it will a xml file using a bunch of predefined widget types, like video, compass, or text.
And then you send data to it over local host (or not local I guess).



Dependencies:
Qt5
rapidjson
opencv

sudo apt install libqt5charts5-dev
